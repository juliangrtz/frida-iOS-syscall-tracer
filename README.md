# frida-iOS-syscall-tracer

An `strace`-like syscall tracer for 64-bit iOS devices based on [Frida's Stalker API](https://frida.re/docs/stalker/). It is not stable yet and often causes the traced process to crash.
The purpose of this tool is to allow you to backtrace certain anti-(jailbreak|debugging|tampering|reverse engineering) techniques that rely on syscalls.
Common file system-based syscalls that are used for anti-jailbreak techniques in many banking apps, for example, are `stat` and `open`. These scan the file system for file names such as _Cydia_, _Sileo_, _/etc/apt/sources.list_ etc.

## Requirements

- npm
- jailbroken iOS device
- frida and frida-tools on the remote device
- frida-server on the iOS device

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliangrtz/frida-iOS-syscall-tracer
cd frida-iOS-syscall-tracer
npm install
```

## Usage example

```bash
# Adjust config to your liking
nano agent/config.ts

# Be sure the jailbroken iOS device is connected via USB and everything is set up correctly.
frida -Uf com.apple.stocks -l _tracer.js 
```

## Output example

```text
$ frida -Uf com.apple.stocks -l _tracer.js

## Troubleshooting

This tool was tested on several iOS versions (13, 14 and 15) but is not guaranteed to work on all iOS versions.
There is a known issue where Frida is unable to spawn a process and the following error message is displayed: "Failed to spawn: unable to launch iOS app via FBS: The operation couldn’t be completed."
If that occurs try to downgrade frida, frida-tools and frida-server. Also try to patch the application's entitlements.

## To do list (descending importance)

– Add callback functions to patch syscall return values if needed

– Write a script that parses syscall.h files and turns the syscalls into a TypeScript map

– Add proper backtracing

– Improve code quality

– Improve stability

– Support the newest iOS versions
